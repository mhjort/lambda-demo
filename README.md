```

* Create Lambda function with name "LambdaDemo", uberjar as zip file, handler as "lambda-demo.LambdaFn", role the one you created before
* Set your Kinesis stream as an event source (use e.g. 10 as buffer size)
* Enter some test data via repl

```
lein repl
```

```clojure
(use 'lambda-demo.kinesis-util)
